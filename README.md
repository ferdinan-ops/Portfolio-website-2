# Portfolio Website Part 2

<p>Hi!ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>Wellcome to my new portfolio website project.</p>
<p>This is my second responsive portfolio website that I created myself with a pretty nice and modern look to look at. I hope I can develop this website better and more interesting. I'm using Visual Studio code as an IDE and using HTML, a bit of CSS, and bootstrap as a framework to build it.</p>
